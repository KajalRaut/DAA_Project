# DAA_Project(Design and Analysis of Algorithm)

This project is java implementaion of algorithms published in IEEE paper : MULTIPREFIX TRIE-A NEW DATA STRUCTURE FOR DESIGNING DYNAMIC ROUTER TABLES.
(IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTERS 2011)

The functions.java contains all the required function like MPT_INSERT,MPT_LOOKUP,MPT_CREATE,etc.

The execution of code starts with mpt.java file

The secondary nodes are stored in prefix tree using prefixtree.java
